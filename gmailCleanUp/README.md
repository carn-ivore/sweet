# GmailAutomationScripts

This repository contains Google Apps Scripts designed to automate common Gmail tasks, saving you time and effort.

## Scripts

### `findUnsubscribeSenders.gs`

This script scans your Gmail inbox and identifies unique senders with "unsubscribe" links or keywords. It then creates a Google Doc with links to the most recent email from each sender, allowing you to quickly unsubscribe. It also creates a link that will select all emails from that sender for easy deletion.

### `deleteUnsubscribedSenders.gs`

This script allows you to delete all emails from senders you've unsubscribed from. You will need to edit the script to add the senders email addresses to the unsubscribedSenders array.

## Installation and Usage

1.  **Open Google Apps Script:**
    * Go to your Gmail account.
    * Click the settings gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top right.
    * Click "See all settings."
    * Click the "Advanced" tab.
    * Make sure "Google Apps Script" is enabled.
    * Click tools, then script editor.
2.  **Copy and Paste:**
    * Copy the contents of the desired script file (e.g., `findUnsubscribeSenders.gs`) from this repository.
    * Paste the code into the Google Apps Script editor.
3.  **Save the Script:**
    * Click the save icon (üíæ) and give your script a descriptive name (e.g., "Find Unsubscribe Senders").
4.  **Run the Script:**
    * Select the desired function from the dropdown menu (e.g., `findUnsubscribeSenders`).
    * Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è).
    * You will be prompted to authorize the script. Grant the necessary permissions.
5.  **Follow the Script's Instructions:**
    * For `findUnsubscribeSenders.gs` open the created google doc, and follow the links to unsubscribe, and then the delete all links.
    * For `deleteUnsubscribedSenders.gs` edit the script with the needed email addresses, and then run it.

## Best Practices

* **Authorization:** Google Apps Script requires authorization to access your Gmail. Always review the permissions requested by the script.
* **Testing:** Test scripts on a small sample of emails before running them on your entire inbox.
* **Error Handling:** For production use, consider adding error handling and more robust logic to the scripts.
* **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of Gmail's API rate limits, especially when processing large volumes of emails.
* **Manual Review:** Always review emails before deleting them, even when using automated scripts.
* **Exception Lists:** When using deletion scripts, maintain exception lists of senders you always want to keep emails from.
